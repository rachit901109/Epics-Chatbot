      "is very confusing (in medias res).  I’ll present the background a bit here just to lay the groundwork.  Background King Santanu married a strange woman he found by the river.  They had many children and she drowned all of them (I told you she was strange).  The king stopped her from downing the last child (a boy).  She then said she was a goddess and that this child was a god but had to remain on earth as punishment for stealing a sacred cow in a past life.  The child was named Devavratha, but to confuse you he is called Bhishma (one of firm vow).  The goddess went back to wherever it is that goddesses go, and the king continued ruling.  One day he fell in love with a woman who ran a ferry; her name was Satyavathi.  King Santanu asked her father if he could marry her, and he said yes, but only if Satyavathi’s children inherit, leaving poor Bhishma out in the cold.  Bhishma was actually cool with this and said he would remain celibate so that he never had children.  Thus, King Santanu and ferry woman Satyavathi married.  They had two boys: one had no children and died in battle, and one (Vichitravirya) grew to adulthood and married two women (Ambika and Ambalika).  But before\n",

Meanwhile, Vichitravirya’s other wife got with Vyasa and she gave birth to a boy named Pandu.  Dhritarashtra, being blind, realizes he can’t really rule, so he gives his kingdom to his brother Pandu.\n",
